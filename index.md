What Software Engineering means to me 

I feel like my whole life and all of my hard work has been leading up to this course, so that I may one day become a software engineer. I have overcome many obstacles, from taking care of a disabled mother through my teen years causing me to graduate high school late, being kicked out on the street the instant I graduated with nothing to my name but my dog and a broken ’82 firebird, to abusive and drug addicted husbands. All I’ve ever wanted to do is Software Engineering, with no idea how to even begin. Eventually, I left the abusive marriage, joined the army, and took my kids with me, so that I can work my way through college and maybe one day achieve my dreams goals of becoming a software engineer. While in the army, I ended up in network engineering and running a helpdesk, complaining the whole time about how I did not want to be learning networking, I wanted to learn how to make software. I was told that was not going to happen for me because it was impossible for anybody to learn both networking and java. Now here I am, with an Associate’s degree in Computer Studies, several professional computer certifications, and a million college credits later, and I am still completely confused about software engineering. Every day, I question if I am smart enough for this path and consider sticking with networking because that is where most of my knowledge and experience is.
