**What Software Engineering means to me**

I feel like my whole life and all of my hard work has been leading up to this course, so that I may one day become a software engineer. I have overcome many obstacles, from taking care of a disabled mother through my teen years causing me to graduate high school late, being kicked out on the street the instant I graduated with nothing to my name but my dog and a broken ’82 firebird, to abusive and drug addicted husbands. All I’ve ever wanted to do is Software Engineering, with no idea how to even begin. Eventually, I left the abusive marriage, joined the army, and took my kids with me, so that I can work my way through college and maybe one day achieve my dreams goals of becoming a software engineer. While in the army, I ended up in network engineering and running a helpdesk, complaining the whole time about how I did not want to be learning networking, I wanted to learn how to make software. I was told that was not going to happen for me because it was impossible for anybody to learn both networking and java. Now here I am, with an Associate’s degree in Computer Studies, several professional computer certifications, and a million college credits later, and I am still completely confused about software engineering. Every day, I question if I am smart enough for this path and consider sticking with networking because that is where most of my knowledge and experience is.


**What I Found Important from Chapter 1**

Chapter 1 is full of great advice, a lot of which is relevant to everyone, not just programmers.  I felt that the section on “Building Your Portfolio” is particularly important, especially the part about diversifying your knowledge.  It may seem like a good idea to find one thing to focus on; one technology to become a real expert on.  When employers need someone who knows that technology, they are going to look for someone who knows the most about it.  However, what happens with that technology fades out?  It eventually will, they all do.  When’s the last time you’ve used a Walkman?  Or logged into Myspace?  Or asked Jeeves anything?  When one technology falls, you don’t want to become irrelevant and unemployable because it is the only thing you know.  Also, it is easier to find employment if you have knowledge in multiple areas.  More and more people are going to college than ever before, which means more and more competition for jobs.  Being an expert on only one subject can make it difficult to find a job if there are no openings in that area.  Having knowledge in multiple areas means multiple job opportunities. 


**What I found Important from Chapter 3**

One thing that interested me about chapter three was the importance placed on using command prompt over a GUI.  I hate using command prompt, and struggle to remember commands.  I had no idea that there’s more that can be done in command prompt that can’t be done in a GUI.  I wonder if there’s any reason someone hasn’t created a complete GUI that has all the capabilities of command prompt.
